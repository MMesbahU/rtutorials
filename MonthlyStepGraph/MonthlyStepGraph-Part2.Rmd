Pythonic Philharmonic of Pandas
---------------------------
This Completes the R postion of the walkthrough. Now we are going to replicate the entire exercise in python and javascript. Here I am gonig to use a great package that has been making a big splash in the scientific python community. Based on the R data.frame, it is focused on tabular data. 


```{r test-python, engine='python'}
from pandas import *
df = read_csv("/home/john/rtutorials/MonthlyStepGraph/data.txt", names = ['dates'])
df1 = df.groupby('dates').count()
df2 = df1.asfreq('D').fillna(value = 0) 
print(df.head())
```
