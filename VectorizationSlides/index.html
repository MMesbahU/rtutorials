<h3>A.K.A. Do Nots USES da LOOPS</h3>

	    <h4>For me, one of the largest stumbling blocks in R was the idea of vectorization. The idea of a for loop is one of the most intuitive ideas in programing. If you program in bash or are heavy linux user it is second nature.</h4>


<h4>In R, it is to be avoided. You do not want to explictaly call a for loop.</h4>

	    <h4>Examples</h4>


<pre><code>#bash
for i in 2 4 6 8
do
   echo &quot;$i!!!&quot;
done
echo &quot;Who do we appreciate&quot;

2!!!
4!!!
6!!!
8!!!
Who do we appreciate


# R
for (i in 1:3) {
    print(i)
}

## [1] 1
## [1] 2

<p>Here is a toy example</p>

<pre><code>df = data.frame(col1 = rnorm(1000), col2 = rnorm(1000, 10), col3 = rnbinom(n = 1000, 
    size = 3, mu = 30))
# A simple data.frame
head(df)

##     col1   col2 col3
## 1 2.2859 10.236   53
## 2 1.8041  9.339   17
## 3 0.8539  9.507   60
## 4 1.1585 10.224   18
## 5 0.6259  9.659    6
## 6 1.0728 10.559   18



# Say we want the coloumn-wise mean of the data frame
out &lt;- c()
for (i in 1:dim(df)[2]) {
    out[i] &lt;- mean(df[, i])
    names(out)[i] &lt;- colnames(df)[i]
}

print(out)

##     col1     col2     col3 
## -0.02744  9.97594 30.01700

<p>In the words of the Bruno, nish-nish.</p>

<p>We are actually comminting two R-sins here. non-vectorized code and growing objects. What we want is to vectorize using one of the apply-family functions </p>

<pre><code>apply(df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)

##     col1     col2     col3 
## -0.02744  9.97594 30.01700
</code></pre>

<p>Or more simply with the user-friendly sapply variant</p>

<pre><code>sapply(df, mean)

##     col1     col2     col3 
## -0.02744  9.97594 30.01700
</code></pre>

	    <h3>Let&#39;s look at what that just did.</h3>


<p>&#39;apply&#39; functions are used to apply functions over arrays, matrixes or lists. In R you can pass functions as paramaters. The fancy-dancy CS term is that in R functions are first-class citizens. Get comfortable with it because it is used all over the place in R. This is akin to a call back function in async javascipt. </p>

<pre><code>//example with Jquery
$.json(&#39;http://url/&#39;, function(data){
//do fun stuff with data
});
</code></pre>

    </article>
	  <article class = "" id = "slide-7"> 
	    
<p>If this greek to you don&#39;t worry. Just be aware the when we call <strong>sapply(df, mean)</strong>. The mean that we are passing in is not an numeric object but a function. This a flavor of functional languages that is mixed into the R-soup. When we say no loops, obviously somewhere a lttle computer gnome has to loop through the data(thats how computers work right). But this looping is done in the C/FORTRAN code that underlies R and is generally faster. Now back to the <strong>apply</strong> function.</p>

<p>The three paramaters in the apply function are:</p>

<pre><code>apply(
 X = The object we are &quot;looping over&quot;
 MARGIN = the &#39;axis&#39; we are interest in traversing (column-wise or row-wise)
 FUN = the function we want to apply
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Truely if there is one point that I would like you to bring home. Regardless of the spurious lies your mother and Montessori teachers told you over the years, you are not that special or smart. What ever you are doing, it likely has been done before. So if you find yourself rewriting the R-wheel, make sure you poke around before.</p>

<pre><code># the sane way of getting column-wise means
colMeans(df)

##     col1     col2     col3 
## -0.02744  9.97594 30.01700
</code></pre>

<p>Also the built in functions are generally vectorized and optimized. Well I say generally, but you will likely find some nasty stuff when you start poking around.  </p>

<p>If you are doing this kind of data manipulation regularly it is well worth your time to investigate the plyr library. Excelect resource.</p>
